## üìö Product Management Philosophy

> "Great products are built by teams that deeply understand their users, iterate relentlessly, and measure everything that matters."

### My Approach:
1. **Start with Why**: Understanding the problem before jumping to solutions
2. **User-Centric Design**: Putting users at the center of every product decision
3. **Data-Informed, Not Data-Driven**: Balancing quantitative insights with qualitative understanding
4. **Build-Measure-Learn**: Embracing rapid iteration and continuous improvement
5. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Fostering strong relationships across engineering, design, marketing, and sales
6. **Strategic Communication**: Ensuring all stakeholders are aligned and informed
